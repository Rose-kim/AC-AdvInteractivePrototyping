                <h2>What Do Prototypes Prototype?</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>We propose a change in the language used to talk about protoypes, to focus more attention on fundamental questions about
                    the interactive system being designed: What role will the artifact play in a user's life? How should it look and feel? How should it be implemented?
                </strong></p>
                <p>These three questions to build a model of what prototypes prototype are very meaningful. 
                    I have foundation of Industrial Design so that I've experienced pretty different prototypes from interaction designers says.
                    The confusion often happened in team communication for me too. Some prototypes are for just appearance, and some are for functionality.
                    However with this questions, it feels like more clear for me, it can indicate clear goal of the prototype no matter what form it will be. 
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Build multiple prototypes. Since interactive artifacts can be very complex, it may be impossible to create an integrated 
                    prototype in the formative stages of a project, as in the 3D space-planning example. Choosing the right focused prototypes to build is an art in itself.
                </strong></p>
                <p>I strongly agreed with this statement. The beauty of prototype is maker never know how it will work. Users are not fully predictable because we are maker not a god,
                     so sometimes people tend to use it differently, or confused, or likes unexpected aspect of prototyes. So building many prototypes as possible and experiment with it is 
                     the best way to test and get a great result.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Example 8. Animation of the look and feel of a fashion design workspace[E8 Hill 1992].</strong></p>
                <p>It is not a quote but one example from the reading, but this reminded me the Yeezy Supply of Kanye West, now the look is different but this reminded me <a href src="https://www.fastcompany.com/90521691/first-look-kanye-wests-new-website-turns-shopping-into-art">this version</a>.
                    The purpose of those two are very different, but I felt this website demo also highly focusing on look and feel and a bit of Role.</p>
